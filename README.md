# MultipleDiseasePrediction
A complete multiple disease prediction system project using machine learning and  data analytics via python such as :

- **Diabetes**
- **Parkinson's Disease**
- **Heart Disease**

Implemented using Python and popular ML algorithms with training and execution in **Google Colab**.


## 📌 Overview

This project aims to assist in early detection of diseases using simple health parameters by leveraging classification algorithms:

- ✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** for Diabetes & Parkinson's prediction
- ✅ **Logistic Regression** for Heart Disease prediction

All models are trained and evaluated using **Google Colab** notebooks.


## 💡 Features

- 🧪 Predicts likelihood of 3 common diseases using medical data.
- 📊 Interactive Google Colab notebooks for reproducible ML training and testing.
- 🛠️ Clean and understandable Python code with comments.
- 📁 Datasets sourced from trusted medical repositories.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction.gitcd multiple-disease-prediction](https://github.com/BigHero006/MultipleDiseasePrediction

2. Open a Notebook in Google Colab:

- Upload the notebooks and datasets to Google Drive or open directly via Colab.

- For each disease, run the corresponding .ipynb file:

a.diabetes_prediction.ipynb

b.parkinsons_prediction.ipynb

c.heart_disease_prediction.ipynb

3.Run all cells to train and test the models.
